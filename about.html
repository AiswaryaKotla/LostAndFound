    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Our Lost & Found Portal is designed to help students and faculty of our college recover
      lost belongings with ease. Whether it's a water bottle, a phone, or a textbook â€” post it
      here and someone might return it!
    </p>

      This platform is maintained by the college IT department and encourages a responsible, connected campus community.
